<i><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Please ensure your Plotly version is at least version 4. Previous versions could send your resulting visualisations to their Cloud Studio (https://plotly.com/chart-studio/). This was removed as the default behaviour from 4 onwards, in which plotly is exclusively *offline* - see here (https://medium.com/plotly/plotly-py-4-0-is-here-offline-only-express-first-displayable-anywhere-fc444e5659ee). Though there are some safeguards in place to prevent previous versions (the installation process enforces a particular version and a check during runtime to check version), just double check for your own sanity!</i>
